Here I worked on a STDF project for National Authority of Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

The goal was to create a model that can predict the future wave Height for a specific time-steps and also based on specific previous time-steps.

the model learned to predict the wave Height in a coastal area in EGYPT based on previous values of speed, Height and mean wave period.

we used 4 years dataset 2017:2020.

there is preprocessing steps to the satelite data, and there are 3 defereent models I tried.
