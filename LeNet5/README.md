-I applied LeNet5 architecture over 2 datasets: Fruits360 and EuroSatAllBands.

-The second dataset consists of 13 channels not RGB only. 

-I calculated Confusion matrix, Precision, Recall and F1 score for both models.

-Note the I implemented ImageDataGenerator class to fit with 13 channels of satellite images because built in ImageDataGenerator 
deals only with gray scale and RGB images.
